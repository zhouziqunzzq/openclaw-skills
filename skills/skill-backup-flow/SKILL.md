# Skill Backup Flow

Backup skills into a git repo with a repeatable and safer process.

## Quick use

```bash
./scripts/backup_skill.sh \
  --source /home/harry/.openclaw/workspace/skills/remote-android-adb \
  --repo /home/harry/.openclaw/workspace/src/openclaw-skills
```

## What it does

1. Copy source skill into `<repo>/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Run a basic red-flag scan for likely secrets/PII patterns
3. Show findings (if any) for manual sanitization
4. Stage + commit + push when clean

## Notes

- Keep runtime/private configs out of backup repo.
- Prefer placeholders in examples (`REPLACE_WITH_*`).
- Review scan output manually before commit.
